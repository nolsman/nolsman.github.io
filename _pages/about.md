My name is Noah Olsman, and I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Systems Biology](http://sysbio.med.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School working with [Johan Paulsson](https://paulsson.med.harvard.edu/). I received my PhD in [Control and Dynamical Systems](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/grad_cds) from the California Insitute of Technology in the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, where I was coadvised by professors [Lea Goentoro](http://goentoro.caltech.edu/) and [John Doyle](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~doyle/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). My research broadly focuses on Systems Biology, where we use the mathematical tools and concepts from engineering, such as sensitivity, robustness, and efficiency, to analyze biological processes.

I was born and raised in Los Angeles where I attended the University of Southern California, majoring in electrical engineering and minoring in mathematics. While at USC my interests largely revolved around robotics. I was a member (and for a while team lead) of the USC Competition Robotics team for four years working on an autonomous submarine for the annual RoboSub competition. After graduating in 2012, I decided to try something completely new and spent about a year working at Yale University in the lab of [Thierry Emonet](https://emonet.biology.yale.edu/) where I developed some new mathematical models of bacterial chemotaxis. In the Fall of 2013 I began my PhD at Caltech, where I worked on understanding the role of feedback control in biomolecular networks. In 2018 I defended by thesis, which focused on [Architecture, Design, and Tradeoffs in Biomolecular Feedback Systems](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11281/). Most of the work is published elsewhere, but if you want to read some of my otherwise-unpublished ramblings about the philosophical foundations of systems biology, check out the introduction of my thesis!

Outside of academia, I severed for four years as the Chief Analytics Officer of the 501(c)3 non-profit [Seed Consulting Group](http://seedcg.org/), which provides pro bono consulting services to environmental groups in California. My initial work with Seed primarly focused on water policy, where I've served as a consultant to both the Natural Resource Defense Council and Heal the Bay. During this time, I founded Seed Insights, a public-facing medium for discussing the environmental issues that our clients and consultants work on. 

My biggest hobby is playing music. I have been playing the slide guitar for years now and recently started playing the mandolin. I was in a short-lived bluegrass band called One-Hick Wonder, whose sole public performance got 3rd place in Caltech's Techstock battle of the bands. We performed a bluegrass cover of the German pop song 99 Red Ballons, it was pretty weird.
